Easy to use free/open source game engine. Or at least that's the vision.
The engine is in a pretty early stage of development right now and the only thing
available is the Core engine, which you should be able to link to with C++

We now have some documentation at [Read the Docs](https://lysanderengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
which should help you if you want to build the engine.
