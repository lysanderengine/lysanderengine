# Lysander Engine

Easy to use free/open source game engine. Or at least that's the vision.
The engine is in a pretty early stage of development right now and the only thing
available is the Core engine, which you should be able to link to with C++

You may want to clone using --recursive to checkout the SFML 2.5 submodule.
